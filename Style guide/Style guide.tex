    This is an example page. A comment or something might go here.
    \begin{theorem}[This is a theorem. A relevant name goes here]
        The theorem itself goes here. The various different boxs can be found in

        \path{/Tex files/enviroments.tex}

        They are all identical except for \texttt{theorem}. It creates a phantom section at the start then adds that line to the table of contents with the same name as the theorem box.
    \end{theorem}

        Here is the code for this page so far, pretty neat right?
        \begin{verbatim}

        This is a proof, its just the standard \texttt{proof} environment.
