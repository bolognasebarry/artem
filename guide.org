#+TITLE: Guide
@MATH1071 so I have created a somewhat formalised system to the document. It is up and runnning at https://github.com/koji314/artem. I believe the plan was to split up the work by lecture.

The gist of it is essentially:
*1.* Fork the notes
*2.* Write your file in the ~lectures~ folder, just barebone, no need to add any preamble or declare document. (Think of it as just content pasted into the main file later on)

   It's important that the filename follows the structure ~<lecture_number>-<title>.tex~,
   for example ~15-Riemann_Integration.tex~.
*3.* Submit a pull request to me through Github.
*4.* :pog:?
